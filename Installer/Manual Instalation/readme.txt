This folder should live in your InDesign "Start-Up Scripts" folder:

Mac
Hard Drive > Applications > Adobe InDesign [Version]> Scripts > startup scripts or
Hard Drive > Users > [username] > Library > Preferences > Adobe InDesign > Version [Version] > [language] > Scripts > startup scripts

Windows 7 and Vista
Hard Drive > Program Files > Adobe > Adobe InDesign [Version] > Scripts > startup scripts or
Hard Drive > Users > [username] > AppData > Roaming > Adobe > InDesign > Version [Version] > [language] > Scripts > startup scripts

Windows XP
Hard Drive > Program Files > Adobe > Adobe InDesign [Version] > Scripts > startup scripts or
Hard Drive > Documents and Settings > [username] > Application Data > Adobe > InDesign > Version [Version] > [language] > Scripts > startup scripts

The simplest way to reveal the location of your Start-Up Scripts folder is to right-click (or Control-click on Mac) the “Application” and “User” listing inside the startup scripts from within InDesign.
The exact location of the startup scripts varies from version to version, but it is either under Window > Automation, or Window > Utilities.
