This folder should live in your InDesign "Start-Up Scripts" folder:

Mac
Hard Drive > Applications > Adobe InDesign [Version]> Scripts > Scripts Panel or
Hard Drive > Users > [username] > Library > Preferences > Adobe InDesign > [Version] 7.5 or 7.0 > [en_US or other language] > Scripts > Scripts Panel

Windows 7 and Vista
Hard Drive > Program Files > Adobe > Adobe InDesign [Version] > Scripts > Scripts Panel or
Hard Drive > Users > [username] > AppData > Roaming > Adobe > InDesign > [Version] > [language such as en_US] > Scripts > Scripts Panel

Windows XP
Hard Drive > Program Files > Adobe > Adobe InDesign [Version] > Scripts > Scripts Panel or
Hard Drive > Documents and Settings > [username] > Application Data > Adobe > InDesign > [Version] > [en_US or other language] > Scripts > Scripts Panel

The simplest way to reveal the location of your Start-Up Scripts folder is to right-click (or Control-click on Mac) the “Application” and “User” listing inside the Scripts panel from within InDesign.
The exact location of the Scripts panel varies from version to version, but it is either under Window > Automation, or Window > Utilities.
