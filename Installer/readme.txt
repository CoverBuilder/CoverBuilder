Manual Installation
-------------------

CoverBuilder is a start-up script for InDesign and must therefore reside 
inside the “startup scripts” folder as shown below:
    Your Application Folder/Scripts/startup scripts/CoverBuilder_INDD_StartUp.jsx

Installing CoverBuilderPS is much the same as installing any other preset. 
Copy the script into the Presets/Scripts subfolder:
    Your Application Folder/Presets/Scripts/CoverBuilderPS.jsx

You can find more information about the installation in the CoverBuilder Wiki
hosted on GitHub:
