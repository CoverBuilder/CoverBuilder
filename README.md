CoverBuilder
============
CoverBuilder exist of two stand-alone scripts: One for Adobe InDesign and one for Adobe Photoshop. All settings from InDesign will be accessible from within photoshop and visa-versa. So you only have to key in your values once.

Most of us get a wide variety of templates supplied from the printer. Some exclude the hinge from the width but include the fold within the flaps (huh?)

The goal of the interface is to never calculate with these values yourself. Therefore you can include(+) or exclude(-) measurements within reading direction and common sense. Making the most awkward templates a no-brainer.

CoverBuilder PS is a standalone script for Photoshop that interfaces effortlessly with the plugin for indesign.
