CoverBuilder
============

Setting up a cover was always a tedious job. As you needed to calculate with the measurements of a wide variety of templates supplied by the printer. The goal of the interface is to eliminate calculating with these values yourself. Therefore you can include(+) or exclude(-) measurements within reading direction and common sense. CoverBuilder makes the most awkward templates a no-brainer.

I found a bug/missing feature!
